# Text-summarization
Design and implement a text summarization system that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to develop a model capable of summarizing lengthy documents or articles, providing a concise representation of the main ideas and key information. The assignment involves both extractive and abstractive summarization methods, allowing students to explore and compare different approaches.
Tasks:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Use the documents shared for training and evaluation.
Preprocess the data by tokenizing, removing stop words, and handling any necessary cleaning steps.
Feature Extraction:
Implement word embeddings for representing words or phrases.
Explore the use of named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging for feature extraction.
Extractive Summarization:
Implement an extractive summarization method using techniques such as sentence scoring based on importance.
Evaluate and compare different scoring approaches.
Abstractive Summarization:
Explore abstractive summarization techniques using deep learning models like transformers.
Implement and compare the performance of different abstractive methods.
Evaluation:
Develop evaluation metrics to measure the effectiveness of the summarization model.
Conduct thorough experiments to assess the model's performance on diverse datasets.
Comparison and Analysis:
Compare the results of extractive and abstractive summarization methods.
Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.
Documentation:
Prepare a report documenting the methodology, implementation details, and results.
Create a presentation summarizing the key findings and insights.
Here are the documents to be used for training.
  


Problem Statement:
Your task is to design and implement a chatbot that can comprehend a given document and answer questions based on its content. The chatbot should take natural language questions from users and provide relevant answers by extracting information from the document.
Tasks:
Dataset Selection:
Use the above documents.
Some of the questions to answer
What is a sensor fusion?
What is BMS?
What are the types of BMS?
What are the Sensor fusion uses cases and Sensor Requirements?
Document Processing:
Implement a method to preprocess and tokenize the document text, preparing it for analysis.
Question Processing:
Develop a mechanism to process and understand natural language questions from users.
Information Extraction:
Use techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) or keyword extraction to identify key entities or concepts in the document.
Model Implementation:
Design and implement a chatbot model that can match user questions with relevant information in the document.
User Interaction:
Enable the chatbot to interact with users, accepting questions in natural language and providing coherent answers. don’t create any screens, just need a python code.
Deliverables:
•	approach to your solution, 
•	able to clearly explain your thought process.  (during interview)
•	your python code. Share it in .py format.
•	For chat bot, accuracy of answers.
